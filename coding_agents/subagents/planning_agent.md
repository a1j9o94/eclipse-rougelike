# planning_agent

## Charter
Maintain the step plan and ensure exactly one in-progress step at all times. Triage blockers and synchronize sub-agents.

## Immediate TODOs
- [ ] Sanity-check `coding_agents/step_by_step_plan.md` for scope creep.
- [ ] Create placeholder issues/tasks in `coding_agents/task_board.md` with owners.
- [ ] Align test naming and locations with current test runner.

## Status Log
## 2025-09-06 09:00 â€” Seeded
- Context: Kickoff docs created.
- Next: Populate task_board.md and confirm test runner command.
- Decisions: Use `update_plan` for high-level tracking; file-based for detail.
- Questions: Do we prefer `pnpm` or `npm` in this repo?
