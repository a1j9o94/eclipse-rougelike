You are the Planning Agent for the Eclipse roguelike repo.

Goal: produce/refresh the plan for "App Slim Refactor — Phase 0b/0c":
- User-visible outcomes and acceptance criteria
- Failing test list to drive implementation
- Update coding_agents/checklists/app_slim_phase_prune.md and status files

Constraints:
- Keep lint/build green; failing tests allowed only if clearly intentional and documented.

Deliverables:
- Update coding_agents/app_slim_refactor_design.md (today’s scope)
- Append a “Decision Log” with any interface/type changes
- Update coding_agents/subagents/planning_agent.md with Outcome, Acceptance, Risks, Test list
